Authors who have been notified of acceptance now have a bit more work to do.

The short version:

* Deadlines (there are some)
* [Formatting Guidelines][formatting]
* [Creating PDFs][creating]
* [Submission Instructions][submission]
* [Licensing][licensing]

However, we recommend you read further...

1. **Deadlines**. 
    * **Monday, October 27th, 2014**.     
    
      You must verify data in the submission database. See the [final submission instructions][submission] for details.

    * **December 1st/7th, 2014**. 
    
      Deadlines for camera-ready copy. Deadline depends on the submission type. Again, details are on the final submission instructions page.

1. **Camera-Ready Guidelines**. The camera ready guidelines are online. Only you can format everything correctly (only you), so please take the time to go through and [make sure you are submitting the best camera-ready PDF you can][formatting]. If you need it, we have some [hints and tips for generating PDFs][creating] from your various document sources.


1. **Final Submission Instructions**. You're going to want to read through the [final submission instructions for SIGCSE 2015][submission]. These are similar to years past, but once again, authors can make life better for everyone if they pay attention to all the details and format papers correctly.

1. **Licensing**. Don't forget we have [new licensing options now][licensing] if you wish to retain the rights to your work.
