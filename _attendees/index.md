## Registering for SIGCSE {{site.data.main.year}}

<div class="row">
  {% include onsiteregistration.md %}
</div>


{{site.data.main.upper}} {{site.data.main.year}} takes place between {{site.data.main.month}} {{site.data.main.start}} and {{site.data.main.month}} {{site.data.main.end}} of {{site.data.main.year}}. [Register now!]({{site.data.main.registrationurl}})

As always, we encourage attendees to register early. This helps us with our planning, and in return, you get lower registration rates!

Also, it is <b>less expensive to join ACM SIGCSE and register for the conference as a regular member than to register as a regular non-member</b>. Joining SIGCSE is {{site.data.main.sigcsemembershipcost}} for professionals and {{site.data.main.sigcsestudentmembershipcost}} for students, and rates for regular member attendees are at least $75 less than regular nonmember attendees at all times. Furthermore, by joining you gain access to an incredible global network of dedicated professionals and educators who are part of the SIGCSE community, so it is a double benefit to join the world’s premier professional computer science education organization!

<p>If you <a href="{{site.data.main.sigcsemembershipurl}}">join SIGCSE</a> ({{site.data.main.sigcsemembershipcost}}/year), you save at least {{site.data.main.sigseregistrationsavings}} on your registration, and gain access to an incredible global network of dedicated professionals and educators who are part of the SIGCSE community.</p>

## Reserving a Room at the {{site.data.main.conferenceHotel}}

{% callout info %}
<div class='text-center'>
  The conference hotel is sold out for Wednesday night, and has <b>ample space remaining Thursday through Sunday</b>. (As of Feb 2nd.)
</div>
{% endcallout %}

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-6">
<p>Our conference hotel is the <b>{{site.data.main.conferenceHotel}}</b>. The rumor on the street in KC is that <i>{{site.data.main.upper}} booked the whole thing</i>. So, take that conference rate, and book rooms for yourself and all of your colleagues—this would be great year to bring the whole department/division/school.
</p>

<p><b>The conference rate is $159 plus tax per night.</b></p>

<p>The room includes free Internet (all of it!), but parking is $16/day in the hotel lot, and $22/day for valet service.</p>

<p><b>Note that the <a href="http://www.visitkc.com/convention-center/index.aspx">KC Convention Center is barely a block away</a> from the conference hotel!</b> Sessions and accommodations are practically under the same roof!</p>

<p>So <a href="{{site.data.main.bookingURL}}">go reserve your room now</a>. Conference room rates are guaranteed until February 3.  Please make your reservations before that date to ensure the SIGCSE rate.</p>

<p>Please note that the SIGCSE rate is guaranteed for three days before and three days after the conference.  There are rooms available during those times.  However, <b>the online system may indicate that the rooms are sold out due to limitations of the reservation system</b>.  Please call the reservation number directly and your reservation can be adjusted for the days you need.</p>

<p>The hotel requires a credit card to hold reservations.  Your credit card will not be charged until your stay.  If you need to cancel your reservation, 24 hours’ notice is required.</p>

## Find a Roommate!

You can also use the [SIGCSE roommate database](http://sigcse.rit.edu/roommates/) to find someone to room with. This is the preferred database of SIGCSE members around the world for finding roommates at the SIGCSE Technical Symposium. Honest.


## If Needed: Overflow Options

Once we fill the conference hotel (it is best if we do!), these are some (relatively) nearby options that might serve for overflow.

* **Alladin Holiday Inn Hotel** ([reservations](http://www.ihg.com/holidayinn/hotels/us/en/kansas-city/mkccc/hoteldetail))

  1215 Wyandotte Street, Kansas City, MO  64105 
  
* **Crowne Plaza Kansas City Downtown** ([reservations](http://www.ihg.com/crowneplaza/hotels/us/en/kansas-city/mkcws/hoteldetail))

  1301 Wyandotte Street, Kansas City, MO 64105

## Getting to SIGCSE {{site.data.main.year}}

### {{site.data.main.nearestAirport}} (Airport Code: {{site.data.main.nearestAirportCode}})

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-12">
<p>
  Our airport is {{site.data.main.nearestAirport}} (<a href="http://www.flykci.com/">http://www.flykci.com/</a>).
</p>
<p>
  The airport's phone number is <b>+1-(816)-243-5237</b>.
</p>

<h3>SuperShuttle</h3>
<p>
   SIGCSE has a <a href="http://groups.supershuttle.com/sigcse.html">SuperShuttle discount code</a> if you want to do that. You can also take a cab or rent a car; those both tend to work the same in most every country I've visited; remember, always tip your cabbie.
 </p>

 <h3>Cab/Taxi</h3>
Cabs/taxies are available from the airport. The fare from the airport to the hotel is approximately $50.

<h3>Public Transport</h3>

<p>
Having spent some time digging around the <a href="http://www.kcata.org/">KCATA website</a> (Kansas City's public transit service), it looks like the <a href="http://www.kcata.org/maps_schedules/routes/129_boardwalk_kci">129 bus service stops at all terminals and provides transit downtown</a>. This is a $1.50 fare (exact change). According to <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Kansas+City+International+Airport,+601+Brasilia+Ave,+Kansas+City,+MO+64153/Kansas+City+Marriott+Downtown,+200+W+12th+St,+Kansas+City,+MO+64105/@39.2268637,-94.6533486,11z/am=t/data=!3m1!4b1!4m16!4m15!1m5!1m1!1s0x87c05e0888e68799:0xc3cdd0195d2edaa0!2m2!1d-94.712594!2d39.300643!1m5!1m1!1s0x87c0f05c3a99cf1b:0x9ccdfaf81d70a39b!2m2!1d-94.586282!2d39.100269!2m1!6e4!3e3">Google's public transit directions</a>, this trip looks to take just over an hour, and you will be dropped off at 10th and Broadway. This is roughly a 5 minute walk from the KC Marriott Downtown.
</p>
<p>
  Please note, the directions regarding bus usage have not been validated or verified by anyone who 1) lives in KC or 2) has ever attempted the journey described.
</p>
<p>
  <img src="{{site.base}}/images/kc/kc-public-transit.png" width="100%" class="image-responsive"></img>

</p>
<p>
  If you decide you want to do public transport, make sure that your arrival time allows for this. For example, the last bus out from the airport seems to be around 11PM; have a backup plan if you think your flight might be delayed and prevent you from catching your bus.
