We are excited about these two affiliated events; both involve excellent educators and technologies that have long been part of the SIGCSE community. Make sure to check out the great work they're doing, and consider joining them in their events.

Greenfoot is one of the most popular educational Java environments. Thousands of institutions are using it to introduce Java programming to novice programmers, in secondary schools and universities.

Now with a completely redesigned revolutionary programming interface, it becomes even more compelling: Introducing a novel interaction method called frame-based programming which combines the best aspects of drag-and-drop systems and textual programming, it provides the ideal transitionary step between direct manipulation systems, such as Scratch and Alice, and full text systems, such as Java and Python.

If you are a programming teacher, or interested in the design of programming systems and environments, then this is for you. Come along and find out what Greenfoot can do for you.

At the end of a long conference day, drinks and nibbles will be provided, with a presentation followed by plenty of time to chat with the Greenfoot development team. 

Don't miss the chance to learn something new in a relaxed session with friends, food, drink and some great give-aways!

If  you're curious to learn more about teaching with App Inventor or have used App Inventor in teaching a course, then you're invited to attend this informal buffet breakfast.  An ``ask and share" format will be used to encourage attendees to participate in the discussion. This event is sponsored by the NSF Computational Thinking through Mobile Computing TUES grants (DUE 1225680, 1225719, 1225745, 1225976, and 1226216). Participants from our Summer 2013 and 2014 workshops will be in attendance to share their experiences teaching with App Inventor.
