As "the flagship international educational exchange program sponsored by the U.S. government" the Fulbright Scholar program has represented both the expertise and the interests of American scholars and academics since 1947. Each year the Catalog of Awards includes approximately 600 listings with almost 400 of them open to scholars in computer science. This presentation will cover the opportunities in teaching and/or research available to computer science educators, how to select countries, make contacts abroad and successfully propose a project for application. Our program staff will be joined by a Fulbright Scholar Alumni Ambassador, Charles Wallace, who received a grant to Chile in Computer Science Education. He will present on the experience of a Fulbright Scholar from the benefits of applying, what his project entailed and the impact it had on him personally and professionally. This presentation will be of particular interest to scholars wishing to expand their research and professional linkages.
