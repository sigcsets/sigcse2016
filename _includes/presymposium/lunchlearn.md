App Lab ([https://code.org/applab](https://code.org/applab)) is Code.org’s rapid-prototyping environment for creating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript-powered web applications. It was created as part of a rich set of instructional resources designed for teachers of the new AP Computer Science Principles (CSP) course. Yet, App Lab far exceeds the needs of CSP, and would be an appropriate learning environment for students in any CS0/CS1 class, even at the university level.

App Lab gives novice programmers access to capabilities previously reserved for courses that require sophisticated tech setup and knowledge of both front and backend web development, server-side scripting, databases, etc.  Rather than focusing on curriculum, this Lunch && Learn will focus on how App Lab works as a programming tool in its own right, and how it was designed to aid and motivate student learning.  In the session we’ll demonstrate a few key exemplars and guide attendees through a few hands-on examples with members of Code.org’s Education team as well as a App Lab’s product manager.
