Computer science classrooms need to better incorporate a wide diversity of perspectives and provide equal opportunities for all students pursuing CS degrees and subsequent careers.

This workshop will provide CS faculty the opportunity to discuss how to create engaging and relevant classroom activities and assignments that will enhance underrepresented studentsâ€™ interest, success and retention in computer science. Examples of engaging and relevant curriculum will be presented from TIDES institutions and the EngageCSEdu repository. Workshop attendees will then be challenged to consider how to modify their own CS courses to be more engaging and relevant.
