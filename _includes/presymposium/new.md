Despite the important role teaching plays in many academic careers, the reality is that many new educators receive only minimal teacher training and are often unsure of what career options are available to them.  How do you choose an institution or career path that is right for you? How do you balance teaching with research, service, and a family life? How do you work effectively with colleagues and survive the tenure process? How do you organize a coherent course, deliver engaging lectures, and build good relationships with students? The goal of the New Educators Workshop is to assist academic-oriented graduate students, post docs, and pre-tenure faculty in exploring questions such as these.  Experienced colleagues from a variety of career paths will be there to share their experiences and best practices.  Small-group discussions will enable attendees to focus on the questions or concerns most relevant to their situations, as well as build a support group of like-minded colleagues.
