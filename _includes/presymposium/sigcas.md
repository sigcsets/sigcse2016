CS educational activities for the social good (CSG-Ed), is an umbrella term meant to incorporate any educational activity, from small to large, that endeavors to convey and reinforce computing's social relevance and potential for positive societal impact.
This SIGCAS sponsored symposium is an opportunity for CSG-Ed practitioners to present their projects/practices. The goal is for current and future CSG-Ed practitioners to share best practices, discover new collaborators, review common pitfalls (and how they can be avoided), and discuss how SIGCAS can support the many varied individual and group CSG-Ed efforts.

See www.sigcas.org for more information about SIGCAS and CSG-Ed in general, as well as how to apply to be CSG-Ed Symposium presenter.
