CS educational activities for the social good (CSG-Ed), is an umbrella term meant to incorporate any educational activity, from small to large, that endeavors to convey and reinforce computingâ€™s social relevance and potential for positive societal impact. This SIGCAS sponsored hands-on workshop is an opportunity to learn the skills necessary to become a CSG-Ed practitioner. In addition to the presentation of current research highlighting the importance CSG-Ed for attracting and retaining a diverse student audience, seasoned CSG-Ed practitioners will lead participants through activities to increase one's ability to deploy CSG-Ed activities and assignments. The goal of this workshop is to create a new cohort of CSG-Ed practitioners and to improve the skill-set of current practitioners.

This workshop is open to both CSG-Ed novices and those with CSG-Ed experience. Attendees will gain new skills, be introduced to new collaborators and be exposed to how SIGCAS can support the many varied individual and group CSG-Ed efforts.

Space is limited to provide a small group hands-on workshop experience.

See www.sigcas.org for more information about SIGCAS and CSG-Ed in general.
