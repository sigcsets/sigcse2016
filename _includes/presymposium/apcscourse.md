You are invited to a luncheon and an open forum on AP Computer Science Principles. This course represents a significant collaboration between colleges and universities and secondary schools. Participants of this luncheon will learn about the important role higher education faculty have held in every step of the development of AP Computer Science Principles as well as facultyâ€™s participation in exam scoring, score setting, and validation. Join us to learn more about the goals of the AP Computer Science Principles course and exam and participate in an interactive discussion around how a credit and placement policy can build deeper interest in the field.
