Write your submission using the format specified above.

Convert your submission into Adobe PDF format. Refer to our [Creating Adobe PDF Documents page](creating_pdf.html) page for assistance.

A PDF version of your submission should be uploaded using the {% include submit.snip txt="online submission system" %}. Submit the PDF version of your submission using the appropriate template. Recall that you will also need to cut-and-paste or type your text abstract description into a text box during the submission process. Please do not wait until the last minute to submit your documents because that is when everyone else will be connecting to our server!

Make note of the proposal ID number and password assigned to your submission. You will receive an e-mail message confirmation. Spam filters sometimes trap these automatically generated messages so you may need to check your spam trap for the confirmation and later, acceptance or rejection notification.

After receiving confirmation, go to the submission site to review your submission for accuracy. Send e-mail to the chair(s) (see below) if there are any problems.
