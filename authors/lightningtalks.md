# What Is A Lightning Talk?

Lightning talks describe works in progress, new and untested ideas, or 
opportunities for collaborative work. The purpose of a lightning talk 
can be to start a discussion, find collaborators, or receive input and 
critique about an idea. Proposals are limited to 1 page (including a 150 
word abstract). Lightning talk presentations will be 5 minutes each and 
given without media/slide support.

# How Should The Proposal Be Formatted?

Lightning Talk proposals are to be provided in PDF format. The full 
proposal contains an abstract and a body that describes your Lightning 
Talk (as detailed below). The abstract needs to appear in two places: in 
the PDF proposal and in a text box on the submission page (see below). 
The format for the Lightning Talk proposal is as follows.

## Lightning Talk Proposal Format and Contents (limited to {{site.data.cfp.details.["Lightning Talks"].limits}})

* **Proposer**: Include name, affiliation, address, phone and fax numbers, 
email address, and Website address (if applicable). This item does not 
count in the page limit. Lightning Talk proposals do not undergo blind 
review, so this information should be included. You should expect most 
correspondence related to the conference to arrive via email. Please 
check your SPAM filter if you haven’t received an expected notification 
because the auto-responses generated by the conference software are 
sometimes blocked.

* **Title**: A title for the Lightning Talk.

* **Abstract**: A description of the Lightning Talk. The same abstract will also 
need to be submitted via a text box on the submission page. Please be 
sure that your description is accurate and that both submitted copies 
(here in the Lightning Talk Proposal, and in the submission text box) 
are exactly the same.

* **Description**: Describe your talk in more detail.  It will be helpful to reviewers to 
know why you are excited about the topic, and why you think others will 
be interested too. Lightning talks are expected to explore tentative or 
preliminary work, or even ideas for possible work.  Presentations of 
mature work will not be considered.

## Lightning Talk Abstract (limited to {{site.data.cfp.details.["Lightning Talks"].abstract}})

The abstract is the description of the Lightning talk that will appear 
on the conference web pages. The description is limited to and must 
match verbatim the abstract section of the Lightning talk Proposal. The 
Lightning talk abstract must be submitted in plain text. The abstract 
for an accepted proposal may contain a URL with more information. 
(Abstracts of accepted Lightning talks can be edited in response to 
reviews.)

# How Do I Submit My Proposal?

Write your proposal using the format specified above.

Convert your proposal into Adobe PDF format. Refer to our Creating Adobe 
PDF Documents page for assistance.

A PDF version of your submission should be uploaded using the <a href="{{site.data.cfp.submissionurl}}">online submission system</a>. Submit the PDF version of your proposal using the Lightning Talk 
template. Recall that you will also need to cut-and-paste or type your 
text abstract description into a text box during the submission process. 
Please do not wait until the last minute to submit your documents 
because that is when everyone else will be connecting to our server!

Make note of the Lightning Talk ID number and password assigned to your 
submission. You will receive an e-mail message confirmation. Spam 
filters sometimes trap these automatically generated messages so you may 
need to check your spam trap for the confirmation and later, acceptance 
or rejection notification.

After receiving confirmation, go to the submission site to review your 
submission for accuracy.
