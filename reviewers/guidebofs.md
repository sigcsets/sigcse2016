Our goal in choosing Birds of a Feather (BOF) sessions is to provide a
selection of discussion sessions that will be attractive to attendees.
With this in mind, answers to the following questions are most useful in
BOF reviews:

-   Is the topic relevant to the symposium?

-   Do you expect that the level of interest in the BOF would be high?

-   Is the proposal suitable for a BOF (recall that BOFs are meant for
    open-ended discussion, and are explicitly not meant for either
    presentations or product demos)
    
-   Are the particular presenters appropriate? (Remember that BOF
    reviewing is not blind.)
    
-   How could the authors improve the quality of the BOF, if it is
    accepted?

Obviously this list is not exhaustive. The Program Committee and authors
will appreciate your views on other issues as well.
