showTitle: true

Our goal in choosing Lightning Talks is to provide a forum to present works in progress, new and untested ideas, and opportunities for collaboration. With this in mind, answers to the following questions are most useful in Lightning Talk reviews:

<ul>
<li>Is the subject relevant to the symposium?</li>
<li>Do you expect that the level of interest in the Lightning Talk would be high?</li>
<li>Is the proposal suitable for a Lightning Talk (recall that Lightning Talks are limited to a presentation time of 5 minutes)</li>
<li>Are the particular presenters appropriate? (Remember that Lightning Talks reviewing is not blind.)</li>
</ul>

Obviously this list is not exhaustive. The Program Committee and authors will appreciate your views on other issues as well.
