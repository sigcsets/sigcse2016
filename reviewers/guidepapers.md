## General Recommendations

Here are some recommendations for writing reviews of submitted papers
that help the authors and improve the quality of the symposium.

-   Your job as a reviewer is to write detailed reviews, even for
    excellent papers. In addition to telling the authors what you didn't
    like about their paper, be sure to include what you did like as
    well.
    
-   Even if your opinion is that the paper is poorly written or poorly
    thought-out, you can still provide constructive criticisms to help
    the authors, and in the long run, the conference. Think of your goal
    as convincing the authors of the paper you're reviewing to submit
    something else next year, but of such high quality that it will be
    well-reviewed and easily accepted. Give the authors advice on how to
    do that.
    
-   The best reviews clearly justify the reviewer's choice of rating.
    The least valuable review gives a low score with no written
    comments. That simply tells the authors that they have been
    unsuccessful, with no indication of how or why.
    
-   The focus of your review should be on content.

-   Papers that you review are supposed to be anonymous. Your review
    should be based on the merits of the paper, not the reputation of
    the authors or their institutions. Therefore, we have asked the
    authors to remove all identifiable references to themselves. We
    realize that reviewers sometimes know the work and can guess who the
    authors of the papers might be.
    
-   If you recognize the work, it is your responsibility to give a fair
    and unbiased review, using only the information in the paper. If you
    do not feel that you can give a fair, unbiased review of the paper
    and not the authors or institutions, please contact the program
    chairs immediately.
    
-   Your review should not include comments to the authors about the
    anonymization (or lack thereof) in the paper. If you feel that it is
    necessary to comment on this, please use the text box, 'Confidential
    comments to the committee.'
    
-   We realize that occasionally anonymization requires the authors to
    remove information that affects your review (information that
    otherwise the paper appears to lack). As a reviewer, you can give
    the authors the benefit of the doubt. Use the 'Confidential comments
    to the committee' box to indicate this to us. Example "This paper
    should reference Matt Jadud's work, unless those references were
    removed for anonymity").
    
-   Please point out typographic and grammatical errors; if there are
    too many to list, please state so in your review.
    
-   Although {{site.data.main.upper}} requires all submitted papers to be polished work,
    all accepted authors get a brief opportunity to improve the
    presentation of their paper before camera-ready copy is due. Your
    detailed feedback may help improve a paper, and in a small way,
    improve the conference.

## Substandard Recommendations

{{site.data.main.upper}} {{site.data.main.year}} will use a [meta-review
process][metareviews] after reviews have been submitted. Reviews
that do not objectively, accurately, and clearly assess a paper's
suitability for publication at {{site.data.main.upper}}, founded in the reviewer's
disciplinary expertise and on the basis of the written paper's
originality, technical soundness, contribution to CS education, and
clarity of presentation, may be deleted.

For example, an unacceptable review might:

-   be incoherent, unreadable, or irrelevant to the paper;

-   focus on the paper's topic area or presumed authors at the expense
    of assessing the paper itself; or
    
-   provide no justification for its numeric ratings. (Even in "obvious"
    cases, reviewers should briefly justify ratings.)

Please note that a difference in rating or opinion with other reviewers
or PC members will NEVER be cause for deletion of a review.

## Examples of Good Reviews

To help reviewers better understand the qualities of good, useful
reviews, here are several example comments, organized by review
category:

### Summary of Submission
-   Please summarize the submission in 2-4 sentences in your own words. Please DO NOT copy/paste the abstract into this section.

### Strengths of this Submission

-   This paper makes a very good argument in the introduction for
    why this course is needed. It is timely, and addresses a topic
    outside of the norm often seen at {{site.data.main.upper}}.
    
-   I can't recall ever seeing something similar at {{site.data.main.upper}}. In spite
    of the previous problems, I would urge acceptance of this paper
    on a topic that we rarely see at {{site.data.main.upper}}.
    
-   This paper should generate a lot of discussion and have a good
    audience. It is a topic that many schools are trying to address
    (including mine.)
    
-   Good level of detail on your approach. Table 2 is very handy.
    Under Section 2, it seems like log analysis and auditing may fit
    in your column two. How will you ensure additional security
    emphasis is implemented?
    
-   The organization is faultless. It is very clear what the paper
    is going to say and how. The paper follows through with crystal
    clear subject headings and a logical flow of information.

### Comments for Authors / Areas for Improvement

-   The hypotheses are too obvious and the validation of them is not
    enough. Therefore, the contribution of this paper is quite
    limited.
    
-   Hard to judge given the writing organization problems, but I do
    not see a lot of significance here. The verification that the
    laboratory helped more than on-line component alone is a nice
    result, if it is supported by the data. Having taught this
    course already and collected feedback on your approach makes the
    paper stronger.
    
-   It is important for those who might be considering this approach
    to know that it can be successful. If I were considering this
    approach I would want to know if the students could understand
    the code, and how deeply I could get into the material given
    time constraints.
    
-   I would have liked to see some discussion and references setting
    this work in the context of other studies of student learning
    and knowledge retention. While I don't know of other studies
    that have examined exactly the phenomenon this paper does, a
    short search in the ACM digital library turned up these examples
    that are relevant...
    
-   The paper could use additional proofing and polishing. I suggest
    finding a non-robotics person to read for both language and
    communication. Some sentences are poorly formed (e.g., sent. 1
    of last par. in sec. 1). Some content seems misplaced (e.g.,
    discussion of mobility in section 3).
