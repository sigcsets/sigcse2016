## Frequently Asked Questions

1. How old/young can my child(ren) be to register?

    Care will be provided for children ages 6 months to 12 yrs. If you have an older child who wants to attend, please contact us.

1. How much does it cost?

    See the fees section above.

1. Where will Kids Camp be located?

    Kids Camp will be conveniently located in the conference hotel. Visiting your children will be easy, yet they are comfortably away from the main conference traffic.

1. What will my child(ren) be doing while I am attending the conference?

    SIGCSE Kid Campers will participate in drama, play, and arts & crafts activities. Older kids can participate in our planned computing activities, which include game or story development using Scratch, many CS Unplugged activities, and Google's CS First activities. Student volunteers will help with the computing activities. We will also have the ever-popular scavenger hunt.

    Yes. A change of clothes is strongly recommended for all children. In addition, parents of young children will need to provide any diapers, wipes, baby food, blankets, formula and bottles that may be needed. Snacks and meals will be provided for older children.  If your child has any special dietary restrictions, please plan to provide food for them.

1. How many childcare providers will be in the rooms?

    Daycare provider ratios will be:
    
      * 1:2 for children ages 6 to 11 months old
      * 1:3 for children 1 to 2 years old
      * 1:5 for children 3 to 12 years old
