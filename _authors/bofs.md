## What Is A Birds Of A Feather?

Birds-of-a-Feather (BOF) Sessions provide an environment for colleagues
with similar interests to meet for informal discussion. Proposers of BOF
sessions should serve as discussion leaders only. BOFs are not intended
to be presentations.

## How Should The Proposal Be Formatted?

BOF proposals are to be provided in PDF format. The full proposal contains an abstract and a body that describes your BOF (as detailed below). The abstract needs to appear in two places: in the PDF proposal and in a text box on the submission page (see below). The format for the BOF proposal is as follows.

### BOF Proposal Format and Contents (limited to {{site.data.cfp.details[plural].limits}})

1.  **Proposer**: Include name, affiliation, address, phone and fax
    numbers, email address, and Website address (if applicable).
    This item does not count in the page limit. Birds of a Feather
    proposals do not undergo blind review, so this information
    should be included. You should expect most correspondence
    related to the conference to arrive via email. Please check your
    SPAM filter if you haven't received an expected notification
    because the auto-responses generated by the conference software
    are sometimes blocked.
    
2.  **Title**: A title for the BOF.

3.  **Abstract**: description of the BOF. The same abstract will
    also need to be submitted via a text box on the submission page.
    Please be sure that your description is accurate and that both
    submitted copies (here in the BOF Proposal, and in the
    submission text box) are exactly the same.
    
4.  **Significance and Relevance of the Topic**: Please include
    information about any trends in relation to the topic and
    possibly describe (or cite) evidence to that effect. Your
    objective here is to explain why the topic is significant. You
    should also justify how your BOF will engage participants in
    group discussion and enhance future connections between
    attendees. This information can help your proposal to be
    selected if resources become an issue.
    
5.  **Expected Audience**: Briefly describe the nature and size of
    the expected audience. If you expect a particularly large or
    small audience, please explain why. This information can help in
    room assignment.
    
6.  **Discussion Leader(s)**: Although correspondence will be with
    the proposer above, it will be the discussion leader(s) who will
    be mentioned in Symposium literature. Please list any additional
    such names (besides the proposer) and affiliations here. Be
    certain that you have their commitments to attend the Symposium.
    All discussion leaders must register for the SIGCSE conference
    and be present for the BOF session.
    
7.  **Expertise of Discussion Leader(s)**: Give a summary of the
    qualifications of the discussion leader(s) as it relates to the
    BOF topic being proposed.
    
8.  **Special Requirements, if any**: Because of the informal and
    spontaneous nature of these sessions, A/V equipment is typically
    not provided. That said, please describe any pressing needs you
    feel you will have. Although we cannot guarantee that your
    requested equipment will be available, we will make every effort
    to let you know this well before the conference.

### BOF Abstract (limited to {{site.data.cfp.details[plural].abstract}})

The abstract is the description of the BOF that will appear on the
conference web pages. The description is limited to and must match
verbatim the abstract section of the BOF Proposal. The BOF abstract
must be submitted in plain text. The abstract for an accepted
proposal may contain a URL with more information. (Abstracts of
accepted BOFs can be edited in response to reviews.)

## How Do I Submit My Proposal?

1.  Write your proposal using the format specified above.

2.  Convert your proposal into Adobe PDF format. Refer to our [Creating
    Adobe PDF Documents](creating_pdf.html) page for assistance.
    
3.  Submit the PDF version of your proposal using the BOF template. Recall that you
    will also need to cut-and-paste or type your text abstract
    description into a text box during the submission process. Please do
    not wait until the last minute to submit your documents because that
    is when everyone else will be connecting to our server!
    
4.  Make note of the BOF ID number and password assigned to your
    submission. You will receive an e-mail message confirmation. Spam
    filters sometimes trap these automatically generated messages so you
    may need to check your spam trap for the confirmation and later,
    acceptance or rejection notification.
    
5.  After receiving confirmation, go to the submission site to review your submission
    for accuracy.
