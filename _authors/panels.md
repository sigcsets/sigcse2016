## What is a Panel?

Panel sessions provide an opportunity for expert panel members to
present their views on a specific topic and then to discuss these views
among themselves and with the audience. Panel sessions run for {{site.data.cfp.details[plural].length}}. Usually a panel session starts with a brief introduction of the
panel topic and the participants, followed by short presentations by the
panelists giving their views. The session must allow sufficient
opportunity (about 30 minutes) for an interactive question and answer
period involving both the panelists and the audience.

A typical panel will consist of four participants, including the
moderator. Limiting a panel to 4 participants allows sufficient time for
audience questions. Proposals with more than four panelists *must
convincingly show* that all panelists will be able to speak, and the
audience able to respond, within the session time.

Panel proposal review is not blind. Criteria used in reviewing the
proposals include the likely level of interest of the topic, the
presence of panel members with multiple perspectives on the topic, and
the likelihood that the panel will leave sufficient time for audience
participation.

If the proposal is accepted, all presenters listed in the panel
description will be required to register for the conference and to
participate in the session.

## How Should The Proposal Be Formatted?

The proposal is limited to {{site.data.cfp.details[plural].limits}} that conform to the [SIGCSE
{{site.data.main.year}} Format Instructions](format.html) with the following modifications
and exceptions:

-   When providing author information, indicate which of the panelists
    is the moderator by placing the word "Moderator" in parentheses
    after her/his name.
    
-   Do not include an abstract. Instead, the first section should be
    titled **Summary** and should provide a summary of the panel written
    by the moderator.
    
-   Subsequent sections should contain the position statements of each
    panelist. Title each section by identifying the author.
-   References where appropriate are encouraged, but not required. If
    they are included, they should be placed in a separate section
    titled **References** and should follow the formatting guidelines.

If accepted, the panel description will be allocated {{site.data.cfp.details[plural].limits}} in
the conference proceedings and must adhere to the formatting guidelines
specified above. To facilitate the transition from proposal to
camera-ready copy, it is critical that authors adhere closely to the
formatting specifications and page limits.

## How Do I Submit My Proposal?

Note that you will be required to submit your proposal electronically.

1.  Write your proposal using the format specified above. Within the
    proposal, you must provide Category and Subject Descriptors, General
    Terms, and Keywords, just as paper authors must do. These
    requirements are described in more detail in the [SIGCSE {{site.data.main.year}} Format Instructions](format.html).
    
2.  Convert your proposal into Adobe PDF format. Refer to our [Creating
    Adobe PDF Documents](creating_pdf.html) page for assistance.
    
3.  A PDF version of your submission should be uploaded using the <a href="{{site.data.cfp.submissionurl}}">online submission system</a>. Note that there
    are several ways you must categorize your proposal submission in the
    online system. These categories are used to select the reviewers who
    will evaluate your proposal. Please select no more than 3 categories
    to ensure the best possible match with a reviewer of similar
    interests and expertise.
    
4.  Please do not wait until the last minute to submit your documents
    because that is when everyone else will be connecting to our server!
    
5.  Make note of the proposal ID number and password assigned to your
    submission. **You will need them later.** You will receive an e-mail
    message confirmation. Spam filters sometimes trap these
    automatically generated messages so you may need to check your spam
    trap for the confirmation and later, acceptance or rejection
    notification.
    
6.  After receiving confirmation, go to the to review your submission
    for accuracy. Send e-mail to the Panels chair(s) (see below)
    if there are any problems.


## Presentation Notes

-   All presenters must register for the conference.

-   Panel sessions are {{site.data.cfp.details[plural].length}} in length. The session must allow
    sufficient opportunity (about 30 minutes) for an interactive
    question and answer period involving both the panelists and the
    audience.
    
-   Plan to attend the speakers' breakfast on the morning of your
    presentation. This will serve as a convenient time for any final
    coordination of the presenters.
    
-   The conference supplies a projector but not a laptop. You will need
    to bring a laptop or arrange to use one from another attendee.
    
-   Bring a backup copy of your presentation on a USB stick. This will
    make it possible for all presenters on a panel to make their
    presentations from a single laptop. We especially encourage you to
    consolidate your individual contributions into a single
    presentation. This will result in smoother transitions from one
    speaker to another.
    
-   Wireless Internet access should be available during your
    presentation, but you should, of course, be aware that there is
    always potential for failure.
    
-   Arrive at your room at least 10 minutes before the panel session is
    scheduled to begin.
