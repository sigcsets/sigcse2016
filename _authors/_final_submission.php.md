ACM Author-Izer {.section}
---------------

ACM is introducing the [ACM
Author-Izer](http://www.acm.org/publications/acm-author-izer-service), a
unique service that enables ACM authors to post links on either their
own web page or institutional repository for visitors to download the
definitive version of their articles from the ACM Digital Library at no
charge. ACM Author-Izer also allows the dynamic display of download and
citation statistics for each “authorized” article on the author’s
personal page. By linking the author’s personal bibliography with the
ACM Digital Library, downloads from the author’s site are captured in
official ACM statistics, more accurately reflecting total usage. ACM
Author-Izer also expands ACM’s reputation as an innovative “Green Path”
publisher.

Preparation of Final Copy {.section}
-------------------------

1.  **Verify Conformance to All Formatting Guidelines:**

    **SIGCSE Guidelines** - Double-check that your submission adheres to
    the [SIGCSE 2014 Format Instructions](format.php) and includes all
    required sections (i.e., Abstract, Categories & Subject Descriptors,
    General Terms, and Keywords). These are the same guidelines
    published when you submitted your paper/panel/special session, so
    hopefully you should not have to make any significant modifications.
    We encourage authors to use the [templates available on ACM's
    website](http://www.acm.org/sigs/pubs/proceed/template.html). LaTeX
    users should use
    [sig-alternate.cls](http://sheridanprinting.com/typedept/sig-alternate.cls)
    for papers and
    [sig-alt-release.cls](http://sheridanprinting.com/typedept/sig-alt-release.cls)
    for panels and special sessions.

    **New ACM Reference guidelines.** \
    Elements (in most cases):

    1.  Author(s)
    2.  Year of publication
    3.  Title of 'document' - use initial caps on keywords and end in
        period.
    4.  Name of Site in italics if given, and followed by period.
    5.  Date accessed - Use 'Retrieved' followed by date as Month, DD,
        YYYY followed by 'from'
    6.  Address - Given as '{http|ftp|telnet}://path' and underlined.

    Note: a web address should never be given for a formally published
    document whose citation is complete or for which there is a DOI.
    Only give a web address for informal works or online-only works or
    resources that cannot otherwise be found by citation and/or DOI.
    Author Home page URLs or Institutional Repository URLs are not the
    way to cite formally published literature. If citing a formally
    published online-only publication, use the format for that genre and
    add elements 5 and 6 above.

    **Sheridan Publishing Guidelines** - Your final submission must also
    conform to the formatting rules on the [publisher's
    page](http://www.sheridanprinting.com/typedept/sigcse.htm).

2.  **Insert copyright statement:**

    All papers, panels, and special sessions submissions must have a
    copyright or permission release statement inserted in the lower left
    of the first column.

    **Papers** - The publisher's page [publisher's web page for
    papers](http://www.sheridanprinting.com/typedept/sigcse.htm#insertCopyright)
    provides instructions on how to add the appropriate notice for
    papers.

    **Panels & Special Sessions** - The publisher's page [publisher's
    web page for panels and special
    sessions](http://www.sheridanprinting.com/typedept/sigcse2.htm#insertCopyright)
    provides instructions on how to add the appropriate notice for
    panels and special sessions.

Submission of Final Copy {.section}
------------------------

\<? echo \$mainCameraReadyDeadline; ?\>

Electronic Submissions Only!

THREE SUBMISSIONS ARE NECESSARY BY THE DEADLINE **-- one to the online
database maintained by SIGCSE and two to the publisher. You must also
submit a signed copyright release form or permission form depending on
the submission type.** The instructions below will guide you in
submitting the final copies to the online database and the publisher.

1.  **Complete final editing and create a PDF file of your submission.
    Name your files correctly.**

    Complete final preparation of your submission according to the
    instructions listed [above](#prep), and then convert your paper into
    Adobe PDF format. Be sure to retain a copy of the source document,
    as well. Refer to our [hints on creating PDF
    documents](creating_pdf.html). Name all of your files using your
    SIGCSE submission number and the lead author's last name (e.g.,
    `fp309-turing.pdf`{style="font-size: 1.2em"},
    `fp309-turing.doc`{style="font-size: 1.2em"}, etc.).

2.  **Submit the PDF file of your submission to the SIGCSE online
    database.**

    Using the ID number and password assigned to your submission for
    review, submit the PDF file of the final copy to the SIGCSE online
    database by accessing the .

    This step is necessary because we make the submissions available
    on-line (via links from the on-line program) prior to the start of
    the conference and well before they will be available from the ACM
    Digital Library.

3.  **Submit the PDF and original source file(s) of your submission to
    the publisher of the proceedings.**

    The publisher is to receive (1) the PDF file and (2) a copy of the
    actual source file(s). The source file is needed to allow the
    publisher to extract text and data to produce the metadata for the
    [ACM Digital Library](http://www.acm.org/dl).

    Submit two files (`.doc`{style="font-size: 1.2em"} and
    `.pdf`{style="font-size: 1.2em"}) if using Microsoft Word, or three
    files (`.tex`{style="font-size: 1.2em"},
    `.ps`{style="font-size: 1.2em"}, and
    `.pdf`{style="font-size: 1.2em"}) if using LaTeX to the publisher
    using the instructions on the publisher's website [instructions on
    the publisher's
    website](http://www.sheridanprinting.com/typedept/sigcse.htm#submission).
    Note that the publisher's website will be activated for uploading
    final submission files by November 12. You should have received one
    or more "Submission Reminder" emails from the publisher (from Lisa
    Tolles) that include a customized link for easy submission of your
    paper. Your paper identification number is in the subject of this
    email. Use this number if requested when you enter the publisher's
    site, and also as the first part of your filename.

4.  **After confirmation from the publisher, submit the signed ACM
    Copyright Form or Permission Form.**

    **For papers:** After submitting your document on the publisher's
    website [publisher's
    website](http://www.sheridanprinting.com/typedept/sigcse.htm#C), the
    publisher will send the contact author a confirmation message. After
    your paper has been processed, you will be emailed a link to an
    electronic ACM Copyright Form. Fill out and submit this form. **Note
    that no links to the copyright forms have gone out yet; the
    electronic copyright form is still being set up.**

    **For panels and special sessions:** After submitting your document
    on the publisher's website, the publisher will send the contact
    author a confirmation message with a link to an ACM Permission Form.
    Print the form, fill it out, and fax the form to the publisher. Fax
    instructions for panels and special sessions are available at the
    publisher's web page [publisher's web page for panels and special
    sessions](http://www.sheridanprinting.com/typedept/sigcse2.htm#C).

5.  **Send email to the publications chair to indicate that you have
    completed all of the steps above.**

    Send email to the Publications Chair, Dennis J. Bouvier

    , with the subject line "***type IDnumber name***", where

    -   ***type*** is one of "paper", "panel", or "special session"
    -   ***IDnumber*** is the assigned submission ID number
    -   ***name*** is the last name of the contact author of the
        submission

    For example, the subject line "**paper 309 Turing**" indicates that
    contact author Turing has completed the submission procedures for a
    paper with the submission ID number 309.

    This email will inform the Publications Chair, Dennis J. Bouvier

    , that:

    -   Your final copy has been updated in the SIGCSE online database
    -   You have submitted both PDF and source file(s) to the publisher
    -   You have faxed the signed copyright or permission form to the
        publisher
