## What Kinds Of Papers Are Customary?

**We invite papers falling into the following topic areas**:

<a name="topicareas"> </a>

{% for type in site.data.topicareas %}
  {% cycle 'add rows': '<div class="row" style="padding-bottom: 20px; ">', nil, nil %}
<div class="col-md-4">
  {{type}}
</div>
  {% cycle 'close rows': nil, nil, '</div>' %}
{% endfor %}
{% cycle 'close rows': nil, '</div>', '</div>' %}

And, in truth, probably a few other areas as well, as long as you're within the conference theme and in the realm of  computer science education.

## How Should The Paper Be Formatted?

Authors must submit ONLY an anonymized version of the paper. The goal of
the anonymized version is to, as much as possible, allow the author(s)
of the paper an unbiased review. The anonymized version should have ALL
references to the authors removed (including author's names and
affiliation plus identifying information within the body of the paper
such as websites or related publications). Self-citations need not be
removed if they are worded so that the reviewer doesn't know if the
writer is citing himself/herself. That is, instead of writing "We
reported on our first experiment in 2007 in a previous paper [1]", the
writer might write "In 2007, an initial experiment was done in this area
as reported in [1].

If the paper is accepted for the conference and for publication, authors
will be asked to complete a camera-ready copy that will include all
appropriate author names, citations, and references.

The paper is limited to a **maximum of {{site.data.cfp.details[plural].limits}}** and must adhere to the
[SIGCSE {{site.data.main.year}} Format Instructions](format.html).

[Templates are available in Word, WordPerfect, and
LaTeX](http://www.acm.org/sigs/pubs/proceed/template.html).

If your paper is accepted you will have a chance to modify your
publication version before it is published.

Electronic submission of papers is required.

## How Do I Submit My Paper?

1.  Write your paper using the format specified above. Within the
    anonymized paper, you must provide Category and Subject Descriptors,
    General Terms, and Keywords based on the ACM classification system.
    These requirements are described in more detail in the [SIGCSE {{site.data.main.year}}
    Format Instructions](format.html).
    
2.  Convert your paper into Adobe PDF format. Refer to our [Creating
    Adobe PDF Documents page](creating_pdf.html) for assistance.
    
3.  A PDF version of your submission should be uploaded using the <a href="{{site.data.cfp.submissionurl}}">online submission system</a>. Be sure to choose the appropriate
    [topic areas](#topicareas) when submitting. Your choices help in
    determining appropriate reviewers, and assists the reviewers in
    evaluating the paper from an appropriate perspective.
