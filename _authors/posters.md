## What Is A Poster?

Posters provide an opportunity for an informal presentation featuring
"give and take" with conference attendees. Presenting a poster is also a
good way in which to discuss and receive feedback on a work in progress
that has not been fully developed into a paper.

**Posters should not be previously published or a previous poster**.

Poster proposal review is **not** blind.

Graduate or undergraduate students submitting posters may instead wish
to submit to the [ACM Student Research Competition
(SRC)](src.html) held at SIGCSE {{site.data.main.year}}. Like normal posters,
SRC posters are displayed at the conference, but the top poster authors
also present their work and may win prizes and proceed to the
international ACM Student Research Competition.

## Poster Topic Ideas

The topic of a poster presentation is not limited. However, the topic
should lend itself to presentation in poster format with additional
details available in a handout or URL. You might consider a poster
presentation of teaching materials that you would like to share or
preliminary research findings, such as:

-   imaginative assignments

-   innovative curriculum design

-   laboratory materials

-   effective ideas for recruiting and retaining students

-   computing education research that is in a preliminary stage

Suggestions for poster design are given in [Research Posters
101](http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/332132.332138). (Although these
suggestions were published for student researchers, the ideas are also
applicable to posters for this conference.)


## Poster Presentation
-------------------

Poster presentations at SIGCSE will be competitive and if your proposal
is accepted, your poster will be displayed for a 2-hour time period
Friday during the conference. You will be expected to "present" your
poster at that time. At least one author for each accepted poster must
register for and attend the conference. The space available for your
poster will be 4 feet high by 8 feet wide with a small shelf below.
Power sources are not available.

## How Should The Proposal Be Formatted?


Poster proposals consist of two documents: The full poster proposal
(submitted in PDF format) and a poster abstract (description) which must
be entered into a text box on the submission page. The full proposal is
used for review and includes a copy of the poster abstract. The format
for the proposal should be as follows.

1.  **Poster Proposal Format (limited to {{site.data.cfp.details[plural].limits}})**

    Your proposal should include as much of the following information as
    possible. Please limit your proposal to {{site.data.cfp.details[plural].limits}}. A list of the
    poster titles and authors will be included in the conference
    proceedings and the program. Poster proposals are not published.

    1.  **Proposer**: Include name, address, phone and fax numbers,
        email address (expect most correspondence by email), Web address
        (if applicable), etc. This item does not count in the page
        limit. Poster proposals do not undergo blind review, so this
        information should be included.
        
    2.  **Statement of Topic**: A short title.
    
    3.  **Significance and Relevance of the Topic**: Please include
        information about any trends in relation to the topic and
        possibly describe (or cite) evidence to that effect. Your
        objective here is to explain why the topic is significant. This
        information can help your proposal to be selected if resources
        become an issue.
        
    4.  **Content**: A description of the expected content of the
        poster.
        
    5.  **Abstract (Description)**: The abstract is a short 
        description of your poster ({{site.data.cfp.details[plural].abstract}}).

2.  **Poster Abstract (limited to {{site.data.cfp.details[plural].abstract}})**

    The abstract is the description of the poster that will appear on
    the conference web pages. The description is limited to and must
    match verbatim the abstract section of the Poster Proposal. The
    poster abstract must be submitted in plain text. The abstract for an
    accepted proposal may contain a URL with more information. Abstracts
    of accepted posters can be edited in response to reviews. The
    revised, final abstract will appear on the web pages.


## How Do I Submit My Proposal?
