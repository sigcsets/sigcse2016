Student volunteers are an important part of the {{site.data.main.upper}} Symposium and
have been for many years. Each volunteer works for up to 6 hours,
helping with various conference management activities. You'll interact
with the conference organizers and presenters and will meet other
students from all over the world. More information about the experience,
the benefits, and how to sign up are provided below.

## How do I register to volunteer?

Register for {{site.data.main.upper}} as a student. Note you will need to pay the
registration fee and the costs of any additions to registration, but the
registration fee itself will be refunded once you complete your
volunteer hours.

**SEPARATELY** register as a volunteer with the student volunteering
team.

{% callout warning %}
Please note that while in previous years we have been able to accept
everyone who registered in December and January and often anyone
interested, we cannot guarantee that this is the case every year. Please
try to register as early as possible (you can provide your availability
for shifts closer to the conference start as we understand that it can
take a little while to arrange travel).

Also, please note that if you are no longer able to attend, we greatly
appreciate you going back to the registration system to cancel.

## How do I register to volunteer?

Upon arrival at the conference site, you must check in at the
**Registration Desk** to receive your conference registration packet.
Then visit the **Student Volunteer Office** to check in (so we know you
are around) and to receive any needed instructions or updates.

### Registration Refund

Assuming you have successfully completed your volunteer duties as signed
off by your volunteer supervisor, you are eligible to receive a
registration refund:

-   If your registration was paid in cash, your refund will be paid
    immediately in cash.
    
-   If your registration was paid by credit card, your refund will be
    processed anywhere from one day to one week after the conference
    ends.
    
-   If your registration was paid by cheque, your refund will be a
    cheque issued via ACM, which may take up to one month after the
    conference is over.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Who is eligible to be a student volunteer?

Any full-time student may become a student volunteer. Both undergraduate
and graduate students are welcome. You specify your school affiliation
when you sign up as a volunteer, and you should bring a copy of your
current course schedule to the conference as verification of your full
time status. Students attending the conference for the Research Poster
competition are encouraged to become volunteers as well.

### What if I require a visa?

The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM, {{site.data.main.upper}}'s umbrella
organization) does not issue formal invitation letters for visas.
However, they can issue a visa support letter. For a visa support
letter, please send a request to Laura Bucci (Bucci@hq.acm.org) with the
following information:

-   Name and mailing address as it appears on your passport.

-   The name of the conference you wish to attend ({{site.data.main.upper}} {{site.data.main.year}}).
-   Registration confirmation number.

-   If you are the author of any papers accepted for the conference,
    please provide the title.
    
-   Fax number (visa support letters are not issued via email).

### What are the benefits of student volunteering?

In exchange for 5 hours of conference service (6 hour maximum), you will
receive:

-   Refunded registration fee.

-   A chance to meet and work with students from other schools.

-   Entrance to the student volunteer party.

-   The opportunity to contribute to an effort to improve Computer
    Science education... and our sincere gratitude for your efforts!

Note that in addition to these benefits, since you are a registered
{{site.data.main.upper}} student attendee, you have all the rights of the non-volunteer
student attendees:

-   Access to all sessions, including papers, panels, seminars, and
    birds-of-a-feather discussions.
    
-   Access to all exhibits where book publishers and software vendors
    have displays and activities.
    
-   All conference "coffee" breaks (some food and drink).

-   The main conference reception on Thursday evening (typically
    includes a light dinner).
    
-   The conference luncheon on Saturday afternoon.

### What kinds of work will I do as a student volunteer?

It varies. Duties may include (and are not limited to) the following:

-   You may work at the registration booth organizing attendee packets.

-   You may monitor the exhibit hall entrance to ensure those entering
    have the appropriate conference badge.
    
-   You may count the attendees at various conference sessions.

-   You may hang out at certain sessions to assist the speakers with
    handouts or equipment.

### Do I have a say in what work I do as a student volunteer?

Not much, but we'll do what we can. If you have a skill we are
interested in then you get a chance to indicate that when you are
indicating available work times (e.g. like working children might make
you a great choice to help with kids camp!). We also try to accommodate
students who have a preference for a particular shift or session, but
due to the complexity of scheduling and ensuring we have adequate
coverage at all sessions, we cannot guarantee anything.

### When during the conference will I do my student volunteer work?

This will depend on conference needs; some time periods are busier than
others. Your duties may be broken into separate time periods and even
across separate days. We guarantee no more than 6 hours of assigned work
per volunteer but target an average of 5 hours.

Please note that we'll take your preferences into account whenever
possible, as well as the times you specified that you will be arriving
at and leaving the conference. You will also have the opportunity to
specify when you are presenting a paper or poster. Given those
constraints we will make our schedule.

We recognize that things may change and will do our best make changes as
needed. In return, we ask that you be as flexible as possible as
coordinating a conference is challenging and your role is important!

### Do I have to be there for the whole conference to be a student volunteer?

No. We realize that travel plans and other commitments exist. We hope
that students local to the conference area will be flexible. In
particular, there is always a need for volunteers on Tuesday and
Wednesday, before most of the conference activities begin and before
many of the traveling student volunteers have arrived. We encourage
local student volunteers to be available on Tuesday and Wednesday.

### Can I get funding for travel or hotel expenses?

The conference itself does not provide funding for student volunteers,
but you may be able to get some support through your department or
through another source at your university. You should print your
registration acknowledgment to show to potential funding sources.
