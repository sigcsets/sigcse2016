title: Guide for Reviewers of Special Sessions

Your job as a reviewer of Special Sessions is an important one. Through
your reviews you have the opportunity to help the authors and to improve
the quality of the symposium. Below are some general guidelines for
writing good Special Session reviews:

-   Your job is to write detailed reviews, even for excellent proposals.
    Tell the authors why you liked their proposal, so that they know
    what made it successful.
    
-   If you believe that the proposal is poorly written or poorly
    thought-out, provide constructive criticism to help the authors.
    
-   The best reviews clearly justify the reviewer's choice of rating.
    The least valuable review gives a low score with no written
    comments. This simply tells the authors that they have been
    unsuccessful, with no indication of how or why. It is of no help to
    the members of the Program Committee, who are charged with making
    program decisions based on your reviews.
    
-   Although {{site.data.main.upper}} requires all Special Session proposals to be
    polished work, the authors will have a brief opportunity to improve
    their proposals before camera-ready copy is due. Your detailed
    feedback may help improve a special session and, as a result, the
    conference.
    
-   **DISTINCTION BETWEEN PANELS AND SPECIAL SESSIONS:** Panels present
    multiple perspectives on a specific topic. Special sessions are an
    opportunity to customize and experiment with the {{site.data.main.upper}} conference
    format (e.g. a seminar on a new topic, a committee report, or a
    forum on curriculum issues)

## More Detailed Suggestions

Some examples of information that should be relayed through the review
process for special sessions:

### Summary of Submission
-   Please summarize the submission in 2-4 sentences in your own
    words. Please DO NOT copy/paste the abstract into this section.

### Strengths of this Submission 

Some sample questions to guide your responses in this section):

-   Is the special session topic suitable for the symposium?

-   Do you expect that the level of interest in the special session
    would be high?
    
-   Are the particular presenters appropriate? Does their expertise
    match the panel topic? (Remember that Special Session reviewing
    is not blind.)
    
-   Does the proposal appropriately place the topic in the larger
    context of Computer Science education? Are the authors aware of
    a range of ideas on the topic? If appropriate, do the authors
    cite related work? (In evaluating this, please keep in mind that
    proposals are limited to two pages, so it is unreasonable to
    expect a detailed "Related Work" section or a long
    bibliography.)
    
-   Very Important: Is the structure of the special session
    presentation reasonable?
    
    -   Do the authors describe the structure of the session at an
        appropriate level of detail?
        
    -   Is it clear to you how the session will be run?
    
    -   Is this truly a special session? (Is it a Panel in disguise?
        Is there another format that would be more appropriate?)
        

### Comments for Authors/Areas for Improvement:
-   Is the proposal well-written? Is it clear and well-organized?
    Are there any technical errors?
    
-   Do you have any suggestions for the authors ...

    -   ...to improve the proposal itself (either for publication in
        the proceedings or for submission to a future symposium)?
        
    -   ...to improve the quality of the presentation, if accepted?

Obviously this list is not exhaustive. The Program Committee and authors
will appreciate your views on other issues as well.
