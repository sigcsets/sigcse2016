title: Guide for Reviewers of Demos
showTitle: true

Our goal in choosing Demos is to provide showcase educational tools or projects and provide an opportunity for discussion with their creators. With this in mind, answers to the following questions are most useful in Demo reviews:

<ul>
<li>Is the tool/project relevant to the symposium?</li>
<li>Do you expect that the level of interest in the Demo would be high?</li>
<li>Is the proposal suitable for a Demo (recall that Demos will occur during break times in the exhibition hall)</li>
<li>Is the tool or project sufficiently mature for a reasonable demonstration experience?</li>
<li>Are the particular presenters appropriate? (Remember that Demos reviewing is not blind.)</li>
</ul>

Obviously this list is not exhaustive. The Program Committee and authors will appreciate your views on other issues as well.
